# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
This is my implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Java.
Everything works with two 2-dimensional arrays of booleans. One is for the current state of the board and the other is for the next state.

The board wraps in this implementation so if a glider flies of the right side of the screen it comes back on the left side. 
The dimension of the board can be changed within the code as well as the resolution.
